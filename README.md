#Project Summary
##Overview
This project involves creating a web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The application includes features for user registration, login, and profile management, with a focus on modern UI design and user experience.

Features
User Authentication and Authorization

Registration: Users can create accounts by providing their name, email, and password. Validation ensures required fields are filled out.
Login: Users can log in with their email and password. Successful login saves an authentication token in local storage for subsequent requests.
Profile Management

Update Profile: Users can update their profile information, including their name and email, through a modal dialog.
Change Password: Users can change their password by entering their current password and the new password, with validation to ensure the new passwords match.
Delete Account: Users can delete their account, which removes their data from the system and logs them out.
Dashboard Interface

A responsive dashboard displays user information and offers options to update profile details, change the password, and delete the account.
Navbar: A top navigation bar provides links to update the profile and logout.
Modal Dialogs: Separate modals are used for updating the profile and changing the password, with user-friendly interactions and feedback.
Styling and UX

TailwindCSS: Utilized for styling the application, providing a modern and responsive design.
Animations: Smooth transitions and animations enhance user interactions and overall experience.
Background: The dashboard features a background image with a gradient overlay for a visually appealing look.
Notifications

Toast Messages: Feedback is provided to users via toast notifications for successful actions or errors, improving the usability and responsiveness of the application.
Technical Stack
Frontend: React with React Hook Form for form handling, styled using TailwindCSS.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for API endpoints.
Database: MongoDB for user data storage.
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user sessions.
